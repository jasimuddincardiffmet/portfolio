            <h2 style="width: 70vw; display: flex; align-items: center;">LEO Space Satellite Communication</h2>
            <div class="text">
            <p> The LEO space technologies  theme research concentrates in cutting-edge research and development in the field of ReflectArray antennas, TransmittArray antennas, solar-cell integration in antennas and satellite for self-harvesting power, metamaterials, THz absorbers for reflective coatings, and band pass/stop filters in widespread space technologies. We strive to push the boundaries of knowledge and technology in order to meet the demanding requirements of space exploration and communication. The UWB antennas involves designing and optimizing antennas for various applications, including satellite communication, ground station and remote sensing. By utilizing advanced electromagnetic modelling and optimization techniques, we aim to enhance antenna performance and achieve greater efficiency, reduce signal interferences between transmission and reception. 
                In the realm of metamaterials, the group explores novel materials with engineered properties to achieve unique electromagnetic responses. This research has the potential to revolutionize the design of antennas, allowing for improved bandwidth, efficiency, phase control, beam steering, and miniaturization. Additionally, the team focuses on developing absorbers by reducing reflection, maximum absorption efficiency, near unity incident angle which is essential in reducing interference in space-based communication systems.</p>
